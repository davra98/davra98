I'm a junior Data Scientist in Jakala, a martech company based in Milan. 
I graduated in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Milano-Bicocca, with a thesis titled
"Optimizing the architecture of a neural network: a Bayesian optimization approachwith Wasserstein distance." 

I am very interested in the world of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and extracting value from data with data manipulation
and engineering techniques. Both in college and in the company where I work,I have always had the chance and opportunity to compare and learn from very bright and
talented people and professionals. 

Here you can find a part of my University projects.
